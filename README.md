# face_detection-recognition
This is a repository which contains my project on face detection and recognition.
Face detection- Detection was successfully implemented using Raspberry Pi and OpenCV Haar Cascade classifier. Code can be found in the Raspberry Pi branch
My initial approach was to use Histogram of Oriented gradients and train a CNN over the HOG to detect faces and optimize using Hard negative mining.
Face recognition was successfully implemented in MATLAB using Eigen faces. Trained and tested over ORL dataset. The accuracy obtained was 90%.
This project was my mini project for Junior year. My group consisted of Mayur Nandu, Parth Mehta, Mihir Joshi and myself, Rochan Nehete.

Feel free to check out the code and if you have something interesting, try to commit your changes or post in issues section
